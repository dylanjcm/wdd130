    <p>Hello! My name is Dylan Calderon and I'm from Ciudad Bolivar, Venezuela but I currently reside in SÃ£o Paulo,
      Brazil. I love playing basketball and drawing. I am currently studying Web Development at BYU-Pathway. I am
      excited to learn more about programming, since I think that will open a lot of opportunities for me. I'm trying to
      improve my english, and BYU-Pathway has helped me a lot! I will server a mission in 2026 nad im really excited for
      it, I know that it is an
      opportunity for me to improve and help others to have the blessings of the gospel in their lives!
      I try to become atleast 1% better every day, because I know that overtime that 1% will make a big difference in
      the end.</p>

    <p>In my country, Venezuela, we are blessed with some of the world's most stunning beauty. We have the majestic
      Angel Falls, the tallest waterfall on the planet, and the breathtaking Caribbean beaches of Los Roques, a true
      paradise of turquoise water. Our home stretches from the high Andes mountains to the deep Amazon rainforest,
      filled with incredible life. More than anything, our warmth is in our cultureâ€”you can feel it in the rhythm of our
      Joropo music and taste it in our beloved arepas. It's a land of vibrant nature and passionate people.</p>
